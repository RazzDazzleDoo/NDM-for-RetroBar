# [RETROBAR](https://github.com/dremin/RetroBar) REQUIRED 

A recreation for all the taskbars seen in those old Nintendo Desktop Manager themes for Windows XP!\
The goal isn't to be pixel-perfect accurate, just good enough for now.

# HOW TO INSTALL
1. Have RetroBar installed
2. Download the repo as a ZIP
3. Go to %localappdata%/RetroBar/Themes
4. Extract the ZIP to that folder (Resources folder should be in the same folder as the themes!)
5. Reload RetroBar and your themes should be there!
